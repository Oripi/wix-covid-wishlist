# wix-covid-wishlist
Getting started with Wix Corvid

# What does this walkthrough offer?
In this walkthrough we're going to create our very own Wishlist for a wix website!

we'll learn how to:
* Interact with page elements through Corvid.
* Use some of the various libraries that Corvid exposes us to manipulate our website.
* Create our own database table and use CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on it.

# so let's get started!
the first thing we need is... a website! so let's start by creating a new website where we can try our code. since we're creating a Wishlist for an online store, select the "online-store" option when creating a new website. in case you created a different kind of website you can always enable it through the same menu that you add different elements to your website, just under the `store` section.

now, let's enable Corvid so we'll be able to modify what we need:

next, let's go to "Product Page" and create an `Add to wishlist` button.

### Bonus:
if you wanna be really fancy you can also add a popup that will show once an item has been added to wishlist:

we'll manipulate it later to show and hide with animations.
