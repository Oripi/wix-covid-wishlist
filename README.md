Getting started with Wix Corvid

# What does this walkthrough offer?
In this walkthrough we're going to create our very own Wishlist for a wix website!

we'll learn how to:
* Interact with page elements through Corvid.
* Use some of the various libraries that Corvid exposes us to manipulate our website.
* Create our own database table and use CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on it.

the first thing we need is... a website! so let's start by creating a new website where we can try our code.
then, let's enable Corvid so we'll be able to modify what we need:


next, let's create a new page called "WISHLIST".
